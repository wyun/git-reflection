How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

- It shows clearly what was changed and make modifying big programs easier when hunting down differences.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- When a program changes, some bugs and errors might be introduced. It's a lot easier to switch back to what it was and compare the difference between those files. Then figure out where the bug is. This process saves valuable time and human errors. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

- A user will have more control over logical changes, rather than creating all changes whether it's big or small. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- git works on a project which contains many different files to make it work. Google Docs are like photo, each change is unlikely to impact another file. 

Getting Colored Output

- To get colored diff output, run git config --global color.ui auto

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- git log is used to show the history of changes. git log --stat will show the file names and change percentage for addition/deletion. 
- git diff can be used to compare different commits in git log output. 
- It's best to put new file at the end: git diff [old] [new]. It's easier to see deletion and addition this way. otherwise, it's reversed. not good. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

- There is always a way to revert back to previous working version. This works for code only. If database is changed, what's gonna happen??
