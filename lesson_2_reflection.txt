What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- The git directory is tracked as a repository. i can add files, remove files and change files. the history of those changes can be tracked in history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- staging area can commit partial changes to a repository and commit those changes.  It makes logical commit possible even when more than tracked files are changed.
